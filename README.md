# multi-layer-perceptron
MLP stands for Multilayer Perceptron, which is a type of artificial neural network. Here are some key characteristics of MLPs:

Architecture: MLPs consist of multiple layers of nodes (neurons):

Input Layer: Receives the input data.
Hidden Layers: One or more layers where the computations take place. Each neuron in a hidden layer applies a weighted sum of its inputs, followed by a nonlinear activation function.
Output Layer: Produces the final output, which can be for regression or classification tasks.
Feedforward Network: Information moves in one directionâ€”from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. There are no cycles or loops.

Activation Functions: Common activation functions include the sigmoid, tanh, and ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). These functions introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn complex patterns.

Backpropagation: MLPs use backpropagation for training, a method that adjusts the weights of the network based on the error of the output compared to the desired output. This process is typically done using gradient descent optimization techniques.

Applications: MLPs are widely used in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and time-series prediction, due to their ability to approximate complex functions.

MLPs are a foundational concept in deep learning and serve as the basis for more advanced neural network architectures.
